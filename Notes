Techniques Used to build this project -
1) External CSS  (more no. of css files).
2) Floats to position the elements.
3) Media Queries for Responsive layout.

*Can add a dropdown menu when width<500px for mobile view

Drawbacks -
1) Everytime we have to clear floats.
2) Required take care of overflow.
3) Everytime we have to write HTML code for repetative elements like navigation bar , footer, etc.


How to overcome -
1) Can use Css preprocessors like SASS.
2) Can use Css flex and grid instead of floats.
3) Can create components for repetative elements using  javascript frameworks like Reactjs
